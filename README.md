# :warning: Work in Progress, Incomplete!
# YSF Blender Tools(Modern)
This plugin for blender allows you to import/export YSFlight DNM/SRF File format.


I tried to implement this by converting each line of code from original plugin for newer API. Also since newer Blender supports n-gons we should include support for it instead of triangulation for better optimisation.

- To see colors, press `Z` on your keyboard and then select ``Material Preview``.

# :memo: TODO
1. Add documentation
2. Add export functions
3. fix parent child relations while importing DNM
